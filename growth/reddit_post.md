**Title:** Built a tool to convert bank PDFs to QuickBooks files - free first file

Hey r/[subreddit],

I built a service that converts bank/credit card statement PDFs into QuickBooks-ready QBO files.

**How it works:**
1. Upload PDF
2. Preview extracted data (confidence score, validation summary)
3. Download CSV/QBO if it looks good
4. If parsing fails or needs review, you don't pay

Free first file to try: [Link]

**Privacy:** Files auto-deleted after 30 days, never sold. Payments via Stripe.

Built this because I was tired of manual data entry. Would love feedback!
