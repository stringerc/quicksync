// This is a wrapper to add metadata to the homepage
// Since the page is a client component, we can't export metadata directly
// This file serves as documentation for SEO metadata that should be in the page

// For client components, metadata should be handled via:
// 1. Root layout metadata (already done)
// 2. Dynamic metadata via next/head or structured data in the component
// 3. Or convert to server component with client component children

// Homepage-specific metadata:
// Title: "Bank Statement to CSV/QBO Converter | QuickBooks Ready Files"
// Description: "Convert bank and credit card statement PDFs into clean CSV or QBO files for QuickBooks import. Preview results before payment. Fast, secure, and accurate."
// Keywords: bank statement converter, PDF to CSV, PDF to QBO, QuickBooks import, bank statement to CSV

// Note: Actual metadata is handled in layout.tsx and via structured data below
