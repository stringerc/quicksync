## Template 1: Helpful Introduction

Hi everyone,

I built a tool that converts bank statement PDFs into QuickBooks-ready QBO files. I know many bookkeepers here deal with this regularly.

How it works:
- Upload a PDF statement
- Preview the extracted data (confidence score, validation)
- Download CSV or QBO if it looks good
- If parsing fails or needs review, you don't pay

Privacy: Files auto-deleted after 30 days, never sold.

Would love feedback if anyone tries it!

How much time do you spend manually entering bank statement data?

I built a converter that turns PDFs into import-ready QBO files. Preview before paying - if it doesn't work well, no charge.
